The 'dict' service provides a simple interface for storing and
retrieving (key, value) pairs in a table. Dict.pl is the server
implementation, and Dict.pm is a tied interface to the client
calls. See 'perldoc Dict.pl' and 'perldoc Dict.pm' for details.

Installation

    1. Edit the Makefile and set PERL to the Perl binary you used to
       build perlrpcgen.

    2. make

    3. make install

    4. Run 'Dict/server/dict_svc Dict.pl' to start the server.

    5. Edit example.pl: set the #! line to the Perl binary you used
       to build perlrpcgen, and set the server name to the name of
       your machine.

    6. Run example.pl and see if everything worked.
